## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With this open-source project we want to improve road safety of non-motorized vehicle drivers/riders. We have created prototype of a rear-view radar that notifies the person of a incoming vehicle from behind.

## Origins
This project started as a bachelors degree thesis on Faculty of Informatics and Information technologies (STU Bratislava).

## Goal

Main goal of this project is to improve road safety of cyclists and other vulnarable road users. With rear view radar, cyclist can see incoming vehicles from the rear.
